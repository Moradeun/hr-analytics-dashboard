## üìå Overview
This project is a **Power BI HR Analytics Dashboard** designed to provide data-driven insights into an organization's workforce.  
It brings together key HR metrics such as employee demographics, job levels, promotion status, and job satisfaction, enabling HR teams to make informed decisions for talent management and workforce planning.

## üöÄ Features of the Dashboard
- **Total Employee Count** with gender breakdown
- **Service Year Analysis**
- **Promotion Eligibility Tracking**

- **Active Workers vs. Retrenchment**
- **Distance Status Classification** (Close, Very Close, Very Far)
- **Custom DAX Calculations** for metrics like:
  - Promotion eligibility rate
  - Active worker percentage
  - Service year grouping
  - Distance status distribution

## Challenges Encountered

Data Cleaning & Preparation:
The dataset contained inconsistencies such as missing values and unclear distance classifications, requiring preprocessing in Excel before importing into Power BI.

Complex DAX Measures:
Creating calculated fields (e.g., promotion eligibility rate, active worker percentage) required writing and testing multiple DAX formulas to ensure accuracy.

Balancing Visual Clarity with Detail:
Some metrics were initially overcrowding the dashboard, so I redesigned the layout to ensure the most important KPIs stand out.

## Recommendations from the Analysis

Retention Focus on Mid-Tenure Employees
Employees with 1 to 5 years of service make up the largest segment of the workforce. To retain this critical group, prioritize initiatives that offer clear career growth and development opportunities. Providing tailored training, mentorship, and clear pathways for advancement will help keep them engaged and committed to the organization.

Expand Promotion Pipeline Through Career Development
Currently, only 4.9% of employees are due for promotion, indicating a limited internal pipeline. Implementing structured career development programs can prepare more employees for advancement, helping to build a stronger succession plan and motivate staff to perform at higher levels.

Targeted Job Satisfaction and Engagement Efforts
Departments with lower job satisfaction scores require immediate attention. Conduct focused engagement initiatives such as regular feedback sessions, recognition programs, and team-building activities to improve morale and reduce turnover risks within these teams.

Location-Specific HR Policies to Enhance Retention
Since most employees reside close to the workplace, consider introducing location-based benefits such as flexible working hours, commuter support, or remote work options where feasible. These policies can improve work-life balance and increase overall employee satisfaction, positively impacting retention

## üìú Project Story
This dashboard is more than a visual report, it‚Äôs a reflection of my passion for HR analytics.
My journey into this field started with a curiosity about how organizations can use data to make better decisions about people.
That curiosity grew into a strong interest, motivating me to pursue a Master‚Äôs in Human Resources so I could combine analytical skills with an understanding of people management.

During this project, I wanted to showcase how raw HR data can be transformed into actionable insights.
I used Power BI for visualization and DAX for calculated measures that made the analysis deeper and more accurate.
From employee demographics to promotion eligibility, every visual was built to answer an HR question.
